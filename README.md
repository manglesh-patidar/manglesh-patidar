# Hey! I'm Manglesh Patidar

I'm a student who loves building things with code — whether it's solving DSA problems or making projects that actually do something useful in real life.

💭 My current goal is simple: **become a strong problem solver and turn ideas into working apps.**

---

## 🚀 What I'm Up To
- Practicing DSA daily (LeetCode + Striver Sheet)
- Learning full-stack development, slowly but consistently
- Experimenting with Python + ML projects
- Trying to build a portfolio that actually represents me

---

## 🛠️ Tech I Use / Learning

**Languages I write in:**  
C, C++, Python, JavaScript

**Web stuff I know (or learning):**  
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub, VS Code

**Learning right now:**  
Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (MERN stack)

**Tools I've touched:**  
Postman, Command Line, Pandas, Debugging tools

##  Projects I’ve Made

### 🧾 Resume Scanner – 
A tool that reads a resume and automatically extracts skills / experience / contact details.
It was fun because it felt like I was teaching the computer how to “understand text.”

---

##basic  Flight Price Predictor –
Predicts how much a flight might cost based on airline, time, stops, etc.

---

##  What I'm Learning Next
- DSA topics that scare me (DP, graphs)
- Backend + APIs in Node.js
